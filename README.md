### Etch-a-Sketch

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum.

It's a simulation of the old Etch-a-Sketch toy, where you gotta draw something in a single continuous line (like drawing in a paper without removing your pencil), it was a good introduction to DOM manipulation with JavaScript and practicing HTML and CSS.

You can see it live [here](https://ghfinatti.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).
